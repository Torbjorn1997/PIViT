# PIViT
This is the official pytorch implementation of "PIViT: Large Deformation Image Registration with Pyramid-Iterative Vision Transformer" (MICCAI 2023), written by Tai Ma, Xinru Dai, Suwei Zhang and Ying Wen. Paper link: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-43999-5_57

## Environment
We reimplemented the code on pytorch 1.13 and python 3.7.15. 
## Dataset
We performed retrainingï¼Œvalidation and testing on the Mindboggle dataset. 

We provide pre-trained models on the Mindboggle dataset, trained with two subsets, NKI-RS and NKI-TRT, with images cropped to the size of (160, 192, 160).

The overall framework of the code and the Swin Transformer module are based on [VoxelMorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph) and [TransMorph](https://github.com/junyuchen245/TransMorph_Transformer_for_Medical_Image_Registration), whose contributions are greatly appreciated.
## Test
We provide the [pre-trained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yjFr6bcjv-UcSXVA-VI2UkwWwfpNSTqu/view?usp=drive_link) and two images for testing from the MMRR subset of the Mindboggle dataset. You can test it with the following code:
```code
python test.py --scansdir   data/vol --labelsdir  data/seg --dataset mind --labels  data/label_mind.npz --model model/0980.pt --gpu 0
```
The test results are:
